# Is it safe?
This is an application which allows an user to see which localities of her/his city is prone to criminal activities.

## To do list
- [ ] Development Environment for PWA
- [ ] Figuring out the logic of pre-caching for offline support, given the unique use-case
- [ ] MapBox API to render a map of the locality
- [ ] Parse data from criminal datasets from (data.gov.in)[data.gov.in] and mark regions prone to criminal activities
- [ ] Option to toggle overlay - can choose not to be sad over the sad state of affairs in one's locality and use the app like any other navigation app
- [ ] Add SoS button (information based on what user entered during registration)
- [ ] User Authentication - Firebase?

## What next?
- Allow users to access similar information for other cities
- User Dashboard to edit information provided
- More overlays based on datasets? (might not be the use-case for this webapp)
- Have fun. :p
